World-Happiness-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset to explore factors influencing happiness across countries. Using Python, we clean, visualize, and model the data to gain insights.
##  Dataset
- *Source:* [Kaggle World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- *Columns:* Happiness Score, GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, Social Support, etc.
## Technologies Used
o	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
o	Jupyter Notebook
o	Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
## Key Findings
•	Countries with higher GDP and social support tend to have higher happiness scores.
•	Social support is more influential than GDP alone in determining happiness.
